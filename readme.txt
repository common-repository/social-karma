A winning shortcode to easily link to the social profiles/networks of people that you're writing about.

== Description ==

Scenario: You're writing a post and you want to mention another blogger/person. You decide to link to his blog, his Twitter 
feed and Facebook page. You'd have to do something along the lines of:

`blah blah Mark Bloomfield (Twitter, Facebook, Blog) blah blah`
	
A bit tedious, especially when you factor in the time it takes to select the word, click the chain 
icon, paste in the link, repeat.

Here's where Social Karma makes it really easy... All you do is write a shortcode like this:

[social blog=http://mark.bloomfield.co.za twitter=yellowllama facebook=yellowllama]Mark Bloomfield[/social]

Supported social profiles/networks are:

* A blog URL
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Flickr
* LinkedIn
* Last.fm
* AboutMe
* Youtube
* Vimeo
* Delicious
* Digg
* Posterous
* Tumblr
* Dribbble

*** IMPORTANT: Only the blog URL item requires a full URL. Otherwise, you just enter the username for 
that service and its automatically placed into the URL for that service.***


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `social-karma` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
